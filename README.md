# Active Galactic Nuclei population studies with the additional SCTs

The main objective of this work is to evaluate the population of extragalactic AGN sources that will be realistically detectable for both F4 and M4 configurations and see how the additional SCTs improves the AGN survey

Preliminary sample consists of 912 extragalactic sources from the 4FGL catalog having a known spectroscopic redshift and culminating between 0° and 40° from zenith for CTA-S

Fermi-LAT spectra extrapolated to VHE energies, using either a power law or a log parabolic function, based on a data-driven approached studied by M. Nievas and T. Hassan (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09446.pdf). EBL absorption accounted for using the Saldana-Lopez et. al 2021 model . Energy threshold of 100 GeV, 5 hour exposure using the IRFs provided, 100 instances for each source and configuration.
